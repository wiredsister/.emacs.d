# Gina's Emacs Setup üíΩ

This is my Emacs Init file for OSX (could be tweaked for Linux or Windows). 
A series of Copypastas and works in progress, lovingly dumped without order or care into one large elisp file.

I've included a [help yourself](./help_yourself.md) file that has a cheatsheet for keybindings and links to documentation for the packages I've used here. 

Image gif in Dashboard was made by [u/Meowmarlade](https://www.reddit.com/user/Meowmarlade/). You do not have the right to take this and use it for profit or claim it was your own.

## Caveats ‚ö†Ô∏è

I hacked the dashboard lisp locally to get my colors for the dashboard. Just use `M-x customize-face` and then search for the `Dashboard` group. You can click to go to definition in the elisp for whatever font-color you'd like, for example: 

```elisp
(defface dashboard-heading
  '((t (:weight ultra-light :foreground "hotpink")))
  "Face used for widget headings."
  :group 'dashboard)

```

I've also locally hacked by `Minimap` mode so its background color on the viewer is purple üíü
